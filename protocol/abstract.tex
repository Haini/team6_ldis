A random number generator (RNG) based on the paper from \autocite{Majzoobi2011}
had to be implemented. The paper proposed a solution based on creating a metastable
flipflop. As metastabiltiy requires the violation of setup and hold times a
delay line based on Lookup Tables (\gls{lut}) was introduced to create a phase shift between
clock and data input ports of the flipflop. 
The reproduction of the results was not possible, as placement of the
Combinatorial Logic Blocks (e.g. \gls{lut}) and the routing process influence
the outcomes heavily and change from synthesis run to synthesis run. Therefore
this solution foucuses an making the synthesis process more deterministic
by creating various constraints on the plcaement and routing process.
