Worth a mention: Python is not really suitable for bitwise manipulations, at least without
a good third party library. There exists no bitwise rotation function, and the easiest way
to implement one was by string operations on the binary representation.
One might consider to write future testprograms directly in C as it provides a more
accurate representation of the low level world (e.g. python abstracts the sign bit out of
the actual number).

VHDL can't operate with 64 bit numbers. This led to a long delay in the testbench
generation as it was tried to read the testvectors as integers at first. As VHDL is
limited to 32 bit integers the proper solution is to convert the numbers into hex or
binary beforehand and then read them as std_logic_vectors / unsigned data types.
Reading from file without any complications also requires the VHDL-2008 Standard.
