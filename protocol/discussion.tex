Our main findings were that working with very incomplete data from the authors of the
study (how was the design actually implemented) is very hard. We tried to contact the
authors but got now response in weeks.


The current state of the \gls{trng} requires further investigation as it is not working at
the moment. 

Gladly we could get the project to a point where working with a solid basis would be
possible (e.g. deterministic routing). 
From now on a more intense timinga analysis of the path and optimized placement by hand
would be the way to got.
